            <p>Here you get an insight into my way of working with the mobile app "Made in Cologne".</p>
            <p>For this project I created the concept, the UX and the UI design. The purpose of the app is to combine the functions of website, online store and museum guide. The goal was an optimal design for Android and iOS users.</p>

        <div>
            <h1>structure of procedure</h1>
            <div>
                <h2>user personas and user stories</h2>
                <p>A unique feature of the museum's app is that visitors are very diverse. To get a better idea of who will visit the museum and use the app, I set up different personas. These are based on the standard "Big 5" model of personality research. Based on the respective traits, I created their main flow and needs. This resulted in five personas, whose representative usage patterns and determines the design of the app.</p>

            </div>

            <div>
                <h2>userflow</h2>
                <p>After the personas defined the basic functionalities of the app, these were combined in the userflow. Special attention was paid to keeping the design as simple and intuitive as possible. The successful use of the app significantly determines the impression of the museum and the enjoyment of the visit. There are three main branches that guide the three contents of the app as simply as possible: The guide, the store and the necessary information for a visit.</p>

            </div>

            <div>
                <h2>low and mid fidelity wireframes</h2>
                <p>With the userflow as a basis, low and mid fidelity wireframes were initially created, which still form a lot of flexibility and customization possibilities. Here the focus was on the UX. </p>

            </div>

            <div>
                <h2>moodboard</h2>
                <p>For the visual impression, I created a moodboard. I gathered inspiration from the web and researched the look of other museum apps. Since the "Made in Cologne" museum is mainly for young local artists, I decided to go with a fresh but unobtrusive color palette. This is done with black and white photos so as not to distract from the essence of the app. The typography is based on Android and iOS guidelines.</p>

            </div>

            <div>
                <h2>high fidelity wireframes and user testing</h2>
                <p>Finally, I put the ideas from the mood board and the wireframes together, creating high fidelity wireframes. This was tested by several real users. They were given certain tasks on the basis of which they were supposed to judge the app. I collected and evaluated the feedback. I sorted all feedback that criticized the app's function or appearance according to relevance and adapted the design to the user's needs. The new design was tested again and feedback was collected again until the users were satisfied with the product.</p>

            <div>
                <h2>final mockups</h2>
                <p>Here you get an impression of how the app looks like on your operating system. Whether iOS or Android, the app is optimized for both and offers you a convenient trip to the museum.</p>
